## The Python 3 Standard Library by Example

In this repository you will find the code examples produced during the studies 
of the [Doug Hellmann]() book and [articles series]() about the usage and 
meaning of the Python 3 standard library modules.

The code here will be updated along the time to observe a more actual version 
of the Python 3 coding styles.

Feel free to copy the source code and examples.
