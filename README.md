## The Python 3 Standard Library by Example

In this repository you will find the code examples produced during the studies 
of the [Doug Hellmann]() book and [articles series]() about the usage and 
meaning of the Python 3 standard library modules.

The code here will be updated along the time to observe a more actual version 
of the Python 3 coding styles.

Feel free to copy the source code and examples.

Below you can find the list of the Python Standard Modules linked to its folder:

- [ ] **Text** ([see codes](./Text/))
  - [ ] `string`: Text Constants and Templates ([see codes](./Text/__string/))
  - [ ] `textwrap`: Formatting Text Paragraphs ([see codes](./Text/__textwrap/))
  - [ ] `re`: Regular Expressions ([see codes](./Text/__re/))
